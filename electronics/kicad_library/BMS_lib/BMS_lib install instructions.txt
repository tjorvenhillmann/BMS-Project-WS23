- KiCad Footprint Editor -> Select random footprint(double click) -> edit footprint properties (IC-icon) -> tab 3D models -> configure paths -> new 3D search path -> alias="BMS_3D" Path=path to 3D folder inside of BMS_lib -> OK

There should be a 3d model. The cell holder just has a box as 3d model.
